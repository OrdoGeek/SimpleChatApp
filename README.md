# SimpleChatApp
A simple chat applcation using Python and Socket.io

# DESCRIPTION
This Chat Application was implemented using Python and Socket IO framework, with libraries like join_room, leave_room, send, and others. Also, it is used HTML and CSS. The app allows to connect 2 or more users to the same socket server for starting a conversation.

Note: The App was built with this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkXdvs8H7TA. It was amazing to build this project. I learned so much form it.
